             Grid rows and cols are considered 1-based.  You can specify a 
             subset of the grid by providing the optional values for 
             rowMin, rowMax, colMin, colMax.  The benchmark and the actual 
             will be stored as TAB delimited files.
             Typically, benchmarks are stored in the Datapool\Bench directory.
