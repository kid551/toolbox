	<DIV NAME="list" ID="detail_desc"><detailed_desc xmlns=""><p>For components that are unrecognized, we can make a mouse drag in these 
                to draw fields(rectangles) or do drag and drop, based on stored x,y start 
                and end coordinates. The object containing the starting coordinates is first 
                given context and then a left mouse drag is performed with the stored coordinates.</p>
<p> 
                The coordinate lookup is done with the component name(Field #3) of the record AND 
                Field #5.</p>
<p>
                Typical Data Table records:</p>
<p>
                (1) t MainWindow GenericItem LeftDrag DragName</p>
<p>
                #1 above will contain a GenericItem entry in the MainWindow section with 
                normal recognition information for it .  GenericItem will also have it's
                own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like:</p>
<p><pre>
                DragName="15,30,60,90"    OR
                DragName="Coords=15,30,60,90"
                </pre></p>
<p>
                This will tell Robot to locate the GenericItem Window object and left drag 
                from coordinates 15,30 to 60,90.</p>

                The results from the lookup are appended to the "Coords=" string 
                used by the GenericObject Left_Drag command in Robot (if necessary).  
                So any valid content used with the Left_Drag command can be 
                part of this AppMap entry.</p>
<p>
                Both Fields #3 and #5 are used to locate the item in the App Map.
                This routine does not specify an App Map so only the current Map
                is used and it is expected to be valid.</p>
<p><b>Important TID note.</b> The <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SAFSImageBasedRecognition.htm" target="imagebased" alt="SAFS Image-Based Recognition Doc">TID IBT implementation</a> supports using literal text in 
                this parameter instead of an AppMapSubKey.  If the value retrieved from 
                this field is NOT found to exist in the App Map as a Sub Key then it 
                will be used as literal text as if it HAD been retrieved from the App Map.
                </p><p>
                Any coordinates provided for TID IBT are considered relative to the top-left (0,0) of the 
                image or item found unless PointRelative and\or Hotspot information in the IBT recognition 
                string change this initial relative point to be somewhere else.
