	    	Level is generally considered to be the Z-Order information of the object--where in 
		the Window Z-Order the object (usually a Window) resides.
		Level is combined with another recognition method when the other method does not uniquely identify 
		the windows. For example, if there are multiple windows with the same caption, and Caption is the 
		recognition method being used. The Level qualifier specifies which one of the similarly-identified 
		windows should be targeted for the action, based on the Windows' Z-Order. The first window is a
		ssigned "Level=1", the second "Level=2", and so on. Level serves as a clarifier only and is used 		
		only after all other methods have been attempted.
		<p>
		If the Level cannot be determined then the engine should return -1.
