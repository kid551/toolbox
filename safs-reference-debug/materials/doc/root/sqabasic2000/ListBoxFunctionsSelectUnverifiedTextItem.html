                 <p>No check is performed after the selection to verify success.  
                 This is typically done for cases when the listbox is only temporary

                selection.</p>
<p>Note: RobotJ also uses the identical keyword 'SelectUnverified'</p>
<p>Note: This is the default for RobotJ, in other words, for
                RobotJ, the SelectTextItem and
                SelectUnverifiedTextItem keywords are identical
                because RobotJ does all of the verification internally
                and there is no control over that in it's api.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
