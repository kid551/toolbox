                 Currently we can only TERMINATE processes successfully 
                 providing a TASKID during LaunchApplication.  If we were 
                 unable to get a TASKID, then we will not be able to 
                 terminate the task with this command.
                 <p>For IOS: This simply tries to close any and all instances of the 
                 running XCode Instruments application that is driving the IOS tests.
                 </p><p>For Android testing: The AUT information is configured via the test INI file and 
                 the installed APKs.  There are no parameters to provide to the CloseApplication call when 
                 closing the application under test.
