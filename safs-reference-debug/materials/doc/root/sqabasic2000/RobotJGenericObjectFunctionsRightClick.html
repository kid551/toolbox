                By default we should click on the center of the object.
                <p>We can also right click on any part of an object based on a stored x,y 
                coordinate.  The object containing the coordinate is first given 
                context and then a right click is generated at the coordinate.  Thus, an item 
                or object can be referenced by name even though it is only recognized
                via coordinates.</p>
<p>
                The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND 
                Field #5.</p>
<p>
                Typical Data Table records:</p>
<p> 
                (1) t MainWindow MainWindow RightClick <br>
                (2) t MainWindow MainWindow RightClick AnObject<br>
                (3) t MainWindow  ToolItem  RightClick PrintTool</p>
<p>
                #2 above will contain an AnObject="3,10" entry in the MainWindow section 
                of the Application Map to right click at x=3, y=10 in the MainWindow. <b>For SE+</b>, the 
                coordinate can be percentage format, like "20%,30%". This percentage format indicates 
                the point (20% width of component, 30% height of component) relative to the object.</p>
<p>
                #3 above will contain a ToolItem entry in the MainWindow section with 
                normal recognition information for it .  ToolItem will also have it's
                own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like 
                PrintTool="15,30".  This will tell Robot to locate the PrintTool Window 
                object and right click at the coordinates specified by the reference.
		</p><p>
		Engines should also attempt to support coordinates separated by alternate separators.  
		The most common separators that should be supported would be:
		<ul>
<li>"," (comma) Example: "50,200"</li>
<li>";" (semi-colon) Example: "50;200"</li>
<li>" " (space) Example: "50 200"</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
		Note: the TID supports this command using 
		<a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SAFSImageBasedRecognition.htm" target="imagebased" alt="SAFS Image-Based Recognition Doc">Image-Based Testing</a> 
		techniques and App Map entries as well as literal text coordinates.

                <p>Name of the AppMap subkey to lookup and use for the right click.
                We expect the AppMap or literal text to contain the item in the format "x,y":</p>
<p><pre>
                [ToolItem]

<p>
                The results from the lookup are appended to the "Coords=" string 
                used by the GenericObject Right_Click command in Robot (if necessary).  
                So any valid content used with the Right_Click command can be 
                part of this AppMap entry.</p>
<p>
                Both Fields #3 and #5 are used to locate the item in the App Map.
                This routine does not specify an App Map so only the current Map
                is used and it is expected to be valid.

                this parameter instead of an AppMapSubKey.  If the value retrieved from 
                this field is NOT found to exist in the App Map as a Sub Key then it 
                will be used as literal text as if it HAD been retrieved from the App Map.
                </p><p>
                Any coordinates provided for TID IBT are considered relative to the top-left (0,0) of the 
                image or item found unless PointRelative and\or Hotspot information in the IBT recognition 
                string change this initial relative point to be somewhere else.
