                By default we should click on the center of the object.
                <p>We can SHIFT click on any part of an object based on a stored x,y
                coordinate.  The object containing the coordinate is first given
                context and then a SHIFT click is generated at the coordinate.  Thus, an item
                or object can be referenced by name even though it is only recognized
                via coordinates.</p>
<p>
                The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND
                Field #5.</p>
<p>
                Typical Data Table records:</p>
<p>
                (1) t MainWindow MainWindow ShiftClick <br>
                (2) t MainWindow MainWindow ShiftClick AnObject<br>
                (3) t MainWindow  ToolItem  ShiftClick PrintTool</p>
<p>
                #2 above will contain an AnObject="3,10" entry in the MainWindow section
                of the Application Map to SHIFT click at x=3, y=10 in the MainWindow. <b>For SE+</b>, the 
                coordinate can be percentage format, like "20%,30%". This percentage format indicates 
                the point (20% width of component, 30% height of component) relative to the object.</p>
<p>
                #3 above will contain a ToolItem entry in the MainWindow section with
                normal recognition information for it .  ToolItem will also have it's
                own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like
                PrintTool="15,30".  This will tell Robot to locate the PrintTool Window
                object and SHIFT click at the coordinates specified by the reference.
				</p><p>
				Engines should also attempt to support coordinates separated by alternate separators.  
				The most common separators that should be supported would be:
				<ul>
<li>"," (comma) Example: "50,200"</li>
<li>";" (semi-colon) Example: "50;200"</li>
<li>" " (space) Example: "50 200"</li>
</ul>

                Without this we should click on the center of the object.
                <p>Name of the AppMap subkey to lookup and use for the SHIFT click.
                We expect the AppMap to contain the item in the format "x,y":</p>
<p><pre>
                [ToolItem]<br>
                PrintTool="33,120"      OR
                PrintTool="Coords=33,120"
                </pre></p>
<p>
                The results from the lookup are appended to the "Coords=" string
                used by the GenericObject Shift_Click command in Robot (if necessary).
                So any valid content used with the Shift_Click command can be
                part of this AppMap entry.</p>
<p>
                Both Fields #3 and #5 are used to locate the item in the App Map.
                This routine does not specify an App Map so only the current Map
                is used and it is expected to be valid.

<p><b>Important Abbot note.</b> Presently, there is no support for AppMapSubkey
                specification (5th field).

                If the component is out of view, the click action will not succeed. Normally we will scroll the component into view,

                want the component shift, then we could turn off the auto-scroll ability by setting this parameter to false.<br>
                If this auto-scroll is turned off, user needs to make sure that component is shown by himself.
