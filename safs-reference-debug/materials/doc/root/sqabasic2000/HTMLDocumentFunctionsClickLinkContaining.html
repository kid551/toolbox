                Links within this HTMLDOCUMENT object.  The text of the Link is 
                expected to CONTAIN the text provided by the user at any position in 
                the Link text--not strictly the beginning as in ClickLinkBeginning.</p>
<p>
                Optionally, the user can also specify a match index to indicate that 
                the desired Link is the "nth" Link that matches the text criteria.</p>
<p>
                The text comparison for the Link is NOT case-sensitive by default.</p>
<p>
                Leading and trailing whitespace will be removed from the links as they 
                are compared unless the link in the HTML itself is quoted.
                In addition, any Line Feeds and Carriage Returns will be removed.
                For the link, we use the outerText property to locate the text.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
