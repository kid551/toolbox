                Verify the complete status of the current popup menu with a benchmark file.<br>
                Typically, benchmarks are stored in the Datapool\Bench directory.  
                In that event, only the filename.ext is needed.  There is currently 
                a limit of 32K allowed for this type of comparison.  <br>
                The Window and Component objects are not validated and have no role.
                The Window and Component strings can be any text, but they cannot be blank.
                <p>
                Due to the nature of the verification using a DOS file comparison, the popup 
                menu will no longer be present after the verification and must be reactivated 
                if additional popup menu activity is to occur.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
