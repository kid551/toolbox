                By default, hover on the center of the component for 2000 milliseconds.
                <p>We can also hover on any part of an object based on a stored x,y 
                coordinate.  The object containing the coordinate is first given 
                context and then the hover command is generated at the coordinate.  
                Thus, an item or object can be referenced by name even though it is only 
                recognized via coordinates.</p>
<p>
                The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND 
                Field #5.</p>
<p>
                Typical Data Table records:</p>
<p>
                (1) t MainWindow Component HoverMouse           1000<br>
                (2) t MainWindow MainWindow HoverMouse AnObject 2000<br>
                (3) t MainWindow FolderTree HoverMouse Node1 3000</p>
<p>
                #1 above will contain a blank as it's 5th field and 1000 as 6th field, 
                and it will hover at the center of the Component for 1000 milliseconds.</p>
<p>
                #2 above will contain an AnObject="3,10" entry in the MainWindow section 
                of the Application Map to hover at x=3, y=10 in the MainWindow.</p>
<p>
                #3 above will contain a FolderTree entry in the MainWindow section with 
                normal recognition information for it.  FolderTree will also have it's
                own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like 
                Node1="15,30".  This will tell Robot to locate the FolderTree Generic 
                object and hover at the coordinates specified by the reference.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>

                We expect the AppMap to contain the item in the format "x,y":</p>

                Node1="Icon" (or whatever is appropriate)</p>
<p>  
                The results from the lookup are appended to the "Coords=" string 
                used by the hover command in Robot (if necessary).  So any 
                valid content used with the hover command can be part of 
                this AppMap entry.</p>
<p>
                Both Fields #3 and #5 are used to locate the item in the App Map.
                This routine does not specify an App Map so only the current Map
                is used and it is expected to be valid.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
