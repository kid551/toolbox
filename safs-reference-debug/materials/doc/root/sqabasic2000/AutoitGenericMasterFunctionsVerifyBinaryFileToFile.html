             In that event, the filename.ext is needed for both files.<br>

             The command may produce a WARNING if a diff tool for which we 
             have no means to verify the results is configured for use.  
             Consequently, if these warnings are expected, the user can use the 
             "TW" test record type to avoid issuing these warnings.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
