	<DIV NAME="list" ID="detail_desc"><detailed_desc xmlns="">
               Verify the screen shot of a GUI component with a benchmark image file.<br>
               The benchmark file must reside in the &lt;project&gt;\Datapool\Bench folder.
               Only BMP and JPG files can be used as the benchmark. If the extension
               of the bench file is not BMP or JPG, it is considered a BMP file.  
               For RJ and IBT engine, other formats like TIFF (*.tif), GIF (*.gif), 
               PNG (*.png) and PNM (*.pnm) are also supported.
               Optionally the user can specify part of the component to verify.<br>
               The specified GUI component/part must be in the viewing range of its 
               containing window. If portion of the component is displayed in the 
               window, only that portion will be captured; if the component falls 
               completely out of the viewing range of the window, the command will 
               fail. The command makes no attemp to bring the component into view.
             <p>
             NOTE: the command may fail to execute if the user has turned off logging 
             to TestManager via the Robot tools setting.  You may have to enable TestManager
             logging for the command to successfully execute.</p>
<p>
             The command may produce a WARNING if a diff tool for which we 
             have no means to verify the results is configured for use.  
             Consequently, if these warnings are expected, the user can use the 
             "TW" test record type to avoid issuing these warnings.</p>
<p>
	    This command requires that TestManager Image Comparator tool is
	    installed on the machine. Machines having only the Robot Test Agent
	    installed will not be able to usee this command.
             </p>
<p><B>RobotJ (RJ) and IBT Specific Notes:</B><br>
               		1)It requires that Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) be installed
               		on the test machine<BR>
               		2)It supports to save image in format TIFF (*.tif), GIF (*.gif), PNG (*.png)
               		and PNM (*.pnm) 
               </p>
<p><B>Apple IOS specific Notes:</B><br>
               UIAutomation captures all screenshots as PNG images, but SAFS copies and stores them 
               into the image format desired (JPG, BMP, etc.). However, the rootname of the desired 
               output image name must be unique to avoid UIAutomation generating indexed image names 
               we will not be looking for.<br>
               For example, specifying MyImage.JPG and later MyImage.BMP will cause UIAutomation to capture 
               MyImage.PNG and MyImage1.PNG. When attempting to find MyImage.PNG captured for MyImage.BMP 
               we will retrieve MyImage.PNG which is NOT the correct image capture for MyImage.BMP.

              Relative paths suitable for FindSQAFile can be used. Normally,
              the Benchmark file would reside in the Project's Datapool\Bench
              directory. A test file with the same name would be created in
              the Datapool\Test folder. The resulting dif file with .txt
              extension would be saved under the Datapool\Dif folder. The
              extension of the benchmark file should be .bmp or .jpg. If not,
              it is considered a BMP file, i.e. the test file would have a
              .bmp extension.

              Coordinates are relative to the component, i.e. (0,0) and

              parameter is omitted, full image of the component is captured
