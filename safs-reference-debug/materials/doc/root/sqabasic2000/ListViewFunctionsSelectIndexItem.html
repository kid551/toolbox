                It is important to note that some ListViews index their values
                differently.  For example, you may need to select an item by 
                text by using a property whose starting index is 1.  Yet, 
                if you request to seek an item strictly by index, the starting 
                index is 0.  So, the test developer may need to evaluate their 
                ListView object for these differences.
