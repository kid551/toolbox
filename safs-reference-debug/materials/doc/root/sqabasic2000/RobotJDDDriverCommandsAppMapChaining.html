		 The SAFSMAPS service historically looked for values in the 'default' AppMap.  
		 This is typically the last AppMap that was OPENed.  This service will now lookup 
		 values in what is called the AppMap 'chain'.  This chain is simply a 
		 Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) buffer of open AppMaps.  As an AppMap is OPENed it is 
		 placed at the top of the search chain.  AppMaps already in the chain are moved 
		 down the chain and searched in a LIFO order.  This allows a primary AppMap to 
		 be OPENed that might contain many default and shared values while subsequently 
		 opened AppMaps might have overriding entries, entries that build upon the 
		 defaults, or contain locale-specific entries for things like NLS testing.
		 <p>
		 Support is currently provided via the SAFSMAPS service.
