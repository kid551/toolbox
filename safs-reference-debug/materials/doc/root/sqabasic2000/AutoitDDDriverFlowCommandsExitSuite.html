                 Generally only called from Step Driver to exit the current Step 
                 table AND the Suite that invoked it.  The command should have no 
                 effect inside a Cycle table.
                 <p>
                 The Step or Suite table containing the command is exited.  If an ExitTable 
                 processing block has been set by SetExitTableBlock then that block 
                 will be executed.  Otherwise, the table will immediately exit.  </p>
<p>
                 If the table containing the command was a Step table, then the Suite that 
                 called the Step table will also be exited.  If an ExitTable 
                 processing block has been set by SetExitTableBlock for the Suite,
                 then that block will be executed.  Otherwise, the Suite will immediately exit.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
