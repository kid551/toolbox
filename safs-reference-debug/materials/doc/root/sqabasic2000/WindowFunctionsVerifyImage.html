	<DIV NAME="list" ID="detail_desc"><detailed_desc xmlns=""><p>Performs a WindowVP CompareImage OR a RegionImageVP on an object.  
                The benchmark VP must already exist and be an asset of the currently 
                running script.</p>
<p>
                A RegionImageVP can be accomplished by having the name of the VP as an item 
                under the component in the application map.  The item's value must be 
                the coordinate values required by the RegionImageVP (i.e. "65,100,200,250").</p>
<p>
                Example 1: Perform a WindowVP CompareImage</p>
<p>
                MainWindow SomeWindowObject VerifyImage StoredVP</p>
<p>
                (no StoredVP item found in the app map under SomeWindowObject)</p>
<p>
                The named VP (StoredVP) must not exist in the application map.  The 
                entire panel/object of SomeWindowObject will be captured and compared 
                against the StoredVP baseline which must already exist as an asset of the
                currently running script.</p>
<p>
                Example 2: Perform a RegionImageVP on a particular area of the screen</p>
<p>
                MainWindow SomeWindowObject VerifyImage StoredVP</p>
<p>
                (StoredVP found as:</p>
<p> 
                "65,100,200,250"   OR
                "Coords=65,100,200,250"</p>
<p>  
                in the SomeWindowObject section of the app map)</p>
<p>
                The named VP (StoredVP) is found to exist in the application map as a
                subitem in the SomeWindowObject section of the map.  This causes 
                the routine to attempt a RegionImageVP using the map's value of the StoredVP 
                item as the coordinates for the region to capture.  StoredVP is ALSO the 
                name of the VP which must already exist as an asset of the currently 
                running script.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
