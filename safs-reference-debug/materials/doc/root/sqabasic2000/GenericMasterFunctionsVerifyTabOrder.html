  Attempts to verify the tab order of the current object--usually a Window.
  A file is used to store the correct tab order of the interface. </p><p>

  The file is simply a list of component names in the order we expect to find
  them as we tab through the interface.  Each line in the file will contain a
  single component name.  That can be either the real valid Name given to the
  component by development, or the name for the component from the AppMap.  The
  AppMap name is highly recommended to reduce maintenance of the tab order file.
  Blank lines or commented lines are ignored.  Comment lines begin with
  apostrophe(') or semi-colon(;) characters.</p><p>

  Example file:
  <ul>
<li>;Tab Order Benchmark File</li>
<li>;For ClassicC Login Window</li>
<li>(blank)</li>
<li>UserIDComboBox</li>
<li>PasswordEditBox</li>
<li>RememberCheckBox</li>
<li>(blank)</li>
<li>OKButton</li>
<li>CancelButton</li>
</ul>
  This file would normally be placed in the Datapool\Bench directory.</p><p>

  The function will verify that the object order in the interface is the same
  object order that is in the file. This is done by checking the FOCUS
  Property of the current object and using the TAB key for navigation.
  Thus, navigation by the TAB key must be supported by the application.</p><p>

  The routine will only check the tab order for the number of items found
  in the tab order benchmark file.  Thus, the user can perform partial tests
  on different portions of the interface at different times.  Just make sure
  that the item that currently has the focus is the first item in the tab order
  benchmark file when invoking this command.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
