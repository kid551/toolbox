                  This command opens the file, reads it line by line, and sets DDVariables (based on rootname) for each occurrence of string identified by the substring formed between regexstart and regexstop (1 match per line, currently).  regexstart and regexstop must both be valid, non-empty strings or no matching substrings will be found.
                  </p><p>
                  Fully qualified filename is opened and read line by line.  
                  Each line is parsed, searching for a match to the substring formed between regexstart and regexstop.
                  </p><p>
                  When a match is found, the string between regexstart and regexstop is saved in a newly created DDVariable based on rootname and the number of occurrences.  There will be one DDVariable for each match found and a unique "Count" variable specifying how many matches were found.
                  </p><p>
                  The rootname is used as a base to build the DDVariable names which contain the located substring(s) and Count.  For example, if rootname is "Chart" and two substring matches are found, then 2 DDVariables are created to store those substrings and another is created to store the count of matches: 
                  </p>
<ol>
<li>DDVariable Chart1 contains the first substring, and</li>
<li>DDVariable Chart2 contains the second substring. </li>
<li>DDVariable ChartCount contains the number of matches found. </li>
