                By default we should click the center of the object.
                <p>We can also double click on any part of an object based on a stored 
                x,y coordinate.  The object containing the coordinate is first given 
                context and then a double click is generated at the coordinate.  Thus, 
                an item or object can be referenced by name even though it is only 
                recognized via coordinates.</p>
<p>
                The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND 
                Field #5.</p>
<p>
                Typical Data Table records:</p>
<p>
                (1) t MainWindow MainWindow DoubleClick<br>
                (2) t MainWindow MainWindow DoubleClick AnObject<br>
                (3) t MainWindow FolderTree DoubleClick Node1</p>
<p>
                #2 above will contain an AnObject="3,10" entry in the MainWindow section 
                of the Application Map to double click at x=3, y=10 in the MainWindow. <b>For SE+</b>, the coordinate 
                can be percentage format, like "20%,30%". This percentage format indicates 
                the point (20% width of component, 30% height of component) relative to the object.</p>
<p>
                #3 above will contain a FolderTree entry in the MainWindow section with 
                normal recognition information for it .  FolderTree will also have it's
                own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like 
                Node1="15,30".  This will tell Robot to locate the FolderTree 
                object and double click at the coordinates specified by the reference.
  		        </p><p>
		        Engines should also attempt to support coordinates separated by alternate separators.  
		        The most common separators that should be supported would be:
		        <ul>
<li>"," (comma) Example: "50,200"</li>
<li>";" (semi-colon) Example: "50;200"</li>
<li>" " (space) Example: "50 200"</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
		        Note: the TID supports this command using 
		        <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SAFSImageBasedRecognition.htm" target="imagebased" alt="SAFS Image-Based Recognition Doc">Image-Based Testing</a> 
		        techniques and App Map entries as well as literal text coordinates.
		        </p>
<p>For IOS: Any optional coordinates MUST be specified as an integer number between 
		        0-100.  0 represents the extreme left (or top), while 100 represents the extreme 
		        right (or bottom). IOS does not use absolute coordinates, but relative coordinates 
		        representing a percentage of the element width or height.

                <p>Name of the AppMap subkey to lookup and use for the double click.
                We expect the AppMap or literal text to contain the item in the format "x,y":</p>

                [FolderTree]

                </pre></p>
<p>
                The results from the lookup are appended to the "Coords=" string 
                used by the GenericObject DBLClick command in Robot (if necessary).  
                So any valid content used with the DBLClick command can be 
                part of this AppMap entry.</p>
<p>
                Both Fields #3 and #5 are used to locate the item in the App Map.
                This routine does not specify an App Map so only the current Map
                is used and it is expected to be valid.</p>
<p><b>Important Abbot note.</b> Presently, there is no support for AppMapSubkey
                specification (5th field).

<p><b>Important TID note.</b> The <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SAFSImageBasedRecognition.htm" target="imagebased" alt="SAFS Image-Based Recognition Doc">TID IBT implementation</a> supports using literal text in 
                this parameter instead of an AppMapSubKey.  If the value retrieved from 
                this field is NOT found to exist in the App Map as a Sub Key then it 
                will be used as literal text as if it HAD been retrieved from the App Map.
                </p><p>
                Any coordinates provided for TID IBT are considered relative to the top-left (0,0) of the 
                image or item found unless PointRelative and\or Hotspot information in the IBT recognition 
                string change this initial relative point to be somewhere else.
