	<DIV NAME="list" ID="detail_desc"><detailed_desc xmlns=""><p>Performs an UNLOGGED WindowVP CompareImage OR a RegionImageVP on an 
                object then attempts to retrieve and compare OCR text to the expected 
                value provided.  
                The benchmark VP must already exist and be an asset of the currently 
                running script.</p>
<p>
                A RegionImageVP can be accomplished by having the name of the VP as an item 
                under the component in the application map.  The item's value must be 
                the coordinate values required by the RegionImageVP 
                (i.e. "Coords=65,100,200,250").</p>
<p>
                EXAMPLE 1 : Perform a WindowVP CompareImage before OCR Test</p>
<p>
                t, MainWindow, SomeWindowObject, VerifyOCRValue, StoredVP, 1, "Expected Text"</p>
<p>
                (no StoredVP item found in the app map under SomeWindowObject)</p>
<p>
                The named VP (StoredVP) must not exist in the application map if you 
                intend to compare the entire window.  The entire panel/object of 
                SomeWindowObject will be captured and compared against the StoredVP 
                baseline.  This VP must already exist as an asset of the
                currently running script.</p>
<p>
                EXAMPLE 2 : Perform a RegionImageVP before the OCR test</p>
<p>
                t, MainWindow, SomeWindowObject, VerifyOCRValue, StoredVP, DataField, "Expected Text"</p>
<p>
                StoredVP found in Application Map like below:</p>
<p>
                [SomeWindowObject]
                SomeWindowObject="Type=Something...."
                StoredVP="Coords=65,100,200,250"        --- invokes a RegionImageVP
                ....</p>
<p>
                When the named VP (StoredVP) is found to exist in the application map as a
                subitem in the SomeWindowObject section of the map then a RegionImageVP 
                will be invoked using the value of the StoredVP item as the coordinates 
                for the region to capture.</p>
<p>
                StoredVP is ALSO the name of the VP which must already exist as an asset 
                of the currently running script.</p>
<p>
                Once the unlogged VP has been completed, we attempt to retrieve the text
                of a predefined OCR region mask that should exist in the VP.  </p>
<p>
                We can use the OCRRegion value provided from the inputrecord to identify 
                the OCR mask number as needed by the SQAGetOcrRegionText function in Robot.  
                Example 1 above shows we are looking for OCR region #1.</p>
<p>
                The OCRRegion value in the inputrecord can also be a reference in the 
                Application Map in a section with the same name as the VP as shown below.</p>
<p>
                [SomeWindowObject]
                SomeWindowObject="Type=Something...."
                StoredVP="Coords=65,100,200,250"
                ....</p>
<p>
                [StoredVP]
                DataField=1
                AnotherField=2
                ....</p>
<p>
                Example 2 above shows that we have given region #1 a name of DataField.</p>
<p>          
                Once retrieved, the OCR text (if any) is compared against the expected 
                results provided.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
