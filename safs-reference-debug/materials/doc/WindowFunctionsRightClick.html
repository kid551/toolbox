	<DIV NAME="list" ID="detail_desc"><detailed_desc xmlns=""><p>For components that are unrecognized, like ActiveToolbar menuitems, 
                we can right click on these or any part of a Window based on a stored x,y 
                coordinate.  The window containing the coordinate is first given 
                context and then a right click is generated at the coordinate.  Thus, an item 
                or object can be referenced by name even though it is only recognized
                via coordinates.</p>
<p>
                The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND 
                Field #5.</p>
<p>
                Typical Data Table records:</p>
<p>
                (1) t MainWindow MainWindow RightClick AnObject<br>
                (2) t MainWindow  ToolItem  RightClick PrintTool</p>
<p>
                #1 above will contain an AnObject="3,10" entry in the MainWindow section 
                of the Application Map to right click at x=3, y=10 in the MainWindow.</p>
<p>
                #2 above will contain a ToolItem entry in the MainWindow section with 
                normal recognition information for it .  ToolItem will also have it's
                own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like 
                PrintTool="15,30".  This will tell Robot to locate the PrintTool Window 
                object and right click at the coordinates specified by the reference.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>

<BR/>
	<DIV NAME="list" ID="detail_desc"><detailed_desc xmlns=""><p>Name of the AppMap subkey to lookup and use for the right-click.
                We expect the AppMap to contain the item in the format "x,y":</p>
<p>
                [FileMenu]
                Exit=33,120   OR
                Exit=Coords=33,120 </p>
<p>
                The results from the lookup are appended to the "Coords=" string 
                used by the Window Right_Click command in Robot (if necessary).  So any 
                valid content used with the Window Right_Click command can be part of 
                this AppMap entry.</p>
<p>
                Both Fields #3 and #5 are used to locate the item in the App Map.
                This routine does not specify an App Map so only the current Map
                is used and it is expected to be valid.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
