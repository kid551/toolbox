	<DIV NAME="list" ID="detail_desc"><detailed_desc xmlns=""><p>For components that are unrecognized, like ActiveToolbar menuitems, 
                we can double click on these or any part of a Window based on a stored 
                x,y coordinate.  The window containing the coordinate is first given 
                context and then a double click is generated at the coordinate.  Thus, 
                an item or object can be referenced by name even though it is only 
                recognized via coordinates.</p>
<p>
                The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND 
                Field #5.</p>
<p> 
                Typical Data Table records:</p>
<p>
                (1) t MainWindow MainWindow DoubleClick AnObject<br>
                (2) t MainWindow FolderTree DoubleClick Node1</p>
<p>
                #1 above will contain an AnObject="3,10" entry in the MainWindow section 
                of the Application Map to double click at x=3, y=10 in the MainWindow.</p>
<p>
                #2 above will contain a FolderTree entry in the MainWindow section with 
                normal recognition information for it .  FolderTree will also have it's
                own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like 
                Node1="15,30".  This will tell Robot to locate the FolderTree 
                object and double click at the coordinates specified by the reference.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>

	<DIV NAME="list" ID="detail_desc"><detailed_desc xmlns=""><p>Name of the AppMap subkey to lookup and use for the double-click.
                We expect the AppMap to contain the item in the format "x,y":</p>
<p>
                [FileMenu]
                Exit=33,120   OR
                Exit=Coords=33,120 </p>
<p>
                The results from the lookup are appended to the "Coords=" string 
                used by the Window DBLClick command in Robot (if necessary).  So any 
                valid content used with the Window DBLClick command can be part of 
                this AppMap entry.</p>
<p>
                Both Fields #3 and #5 are used to locate the item in the App Map.
                This routine does not specify an App Map so only the current Map
                is used and it is expected to be valid.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
