	<DIV NAME="list" ID="detail_desc"><detailed_desc xmlns=""><p>Sends a SetPosition command to the window to set the position, size, 
                and status of the window.  The position, size, and status information 
                is stored in the app map as a subitem in the section for the window.
                The information should be in the format of:</p>
<p>
                "0,0,640,480;Status=NORMAL"    OR
                "Coords=0,0,640,480;Status=NORMAL"</p>
<p>
                That example positions the window at 0,0; sizes it to 640 x 480, and
                sets it's status to NORMAL.  Valid values for STATUS are:</p>
<p>
                NORMAL, MINIMIZED, and MAXIMIZED</p>
<p>
                The Window SetPosition command has a problem in that it does not want to
                use the same recognition methods used by the other Window commands (like
                SetContext).  Particularly, it does not accept the Type=Window portion
                of these recognition methods.  In addition, if the window is a child
                window of a parent then it expects the ";ChildWindow" add-on in the 
                recognition method.  The child may also need the parent as part of its
                full recognition string like:</p>
<p>
                ChildWindow=Type=Window;&lt;parent rec&gt;;\;Caption=&lt;caption&gt;;ChildWindow</p>
<p>
                To handle these child windows, we parse the typical recognition method for 
                our window and attempt to handle these issues.  Once SetContext has 
                successfully set our window, we then remove any "Type=Window" substring 
                if present and add the ";ChildWindow" substring if not present.</p>
<p>
                To take advantage of this, this routine must be called with the child
                window as a component of the parent window like below:</p>
<p>
                t, ParentWindow, ChildWindow, SetPosition, ChildPositionReference</p>
<p>
                If the routine is called like either of the examples below then default
                processing will occur.  This will merely SetContext on the provided 
                Window and use "CurrentWindow" as the parameter to SetPosition.</p>
<p>
                t, ParentWindow, ParentWindow, SetPosition, ParentPosition<br>
                t, ChildWindow , ChildWindow , SetPosition, ChildPosition   (normally won't work)</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
