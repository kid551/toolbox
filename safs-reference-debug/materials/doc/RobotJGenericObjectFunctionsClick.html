                By default, clicks on the center of the component.
                We can also click on any part of an object, or any point relative to an object 
                based on a provided x,y coordinate or other component-specific parameters.  
                </p><p>
                For SE+, the coordinate can be percentage format, like "20%,30%". This percentage format 
                indicates the point (20% width of component, 30% height of component) relative to the object.
                </p><p>
                The object to be clicked is first given context and then a click is 
                generated at the coordinates.  Thus, a subitem or object can be 
                referenced by name even though it is only recognized via coordinates.
                </p><p>
                The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND 
                Field #5 or by providing the literal text of the coordinates, where supported.</p>
<p>
                Typical Data Table records:</p>
<p>
                (1) t MainWindow MainWindow  Click<br>
                (2) t MainWindow MainWindow  Click AnObject<br>
                (3) t MainWindow FolderTree  Click Node1<br>
                (4) t MainWindow MainWindow  Click "50,200"<br>
                (5) t MainWindow MainWindow  Click "Coords=50,200"
                </p><p>
                For SE+, the Data Table records can be:
                </p><p>
                (6) t MainWindow MainWindow  Click "50%,20%"<br>
                (7) t MainWindow MainWindow  Click "50,20%"<br></p><p>
                #2 above will contain an AnObject="3,10" entry in the MainWindow section 
                of the Application Map to click at x=3, y=10 in the MainWindow.
                </p><p>
                #3 above will contain a FolderTree entry in the MainWindow section with 
                normal recognition information for it.  FolderTree will also have it's
                own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like 
                Node1="15,30".  This will tell Robot to locate the FolderTree Generic 
                object and click at the coordinates specified by the reference.
                </p><p>
                #4 and #5 above show using literal text instead of an App Map entry to specify 
                where to click relative to the item.
                </p><p>
                #6 and #7 above show using percentage format in <b>SE+</b>. #6 will click at position, 
                where the X value equals 50% width of component, its Y value equals 20% height of component, 
                relative to the object. #7 will click at position, where the X value equals 50, 
                its Y value equals 20% height of component, relative to the object.
                </p><p>
                Rational Robot no longer requires the AppMapSubKey be provided and will 
                attempt to use the string as literal text if no AppMapSubKey is found in 
                the current App Map.  Robot also no longer assumes the AppMapSubKey value 
                or the literal value is presenting coordinate information.  This allows 
                components that can accept parameters other than coordinates, like table 
                row/col values or ImageMap areas to be specified.
                </p><p>
                If the value is deduced to contain coordinates, but is not prefixed with 
                "Coords=" text, then Robot will add the prefix.  Otherwise, the text value 
                will remain unmodified.
                </p><p>
		        This is the direction we expect all tools to follow going forward.
		        </p><p>
		        Engines should also attempt to support coordinates separated by alternate separators.  
		        The most common separators that should be supported would be:
		        <ul>
<li>"," (comma) Example: "50,200"</li>
<li>";" (semi-colon) Example: "50;200"</li>
<li>" " (space) Example: "50 200"</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
		        Note: the TID supports this command using 
		        <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SAFSImageBasedRecognition.htm" target="imagebased" alt="SAFS Image-Based Recognition Doc">Image-Based Testing</a> 
		        techniques and App Map entries as well as literal text coordinates.
		        </p>
<p>For IOS: Any optional coordinates MUST be specified as an integer number between 
		        0-100.  0 represents the extreme left (or top), while 100 represents the extreme 
		        right (or bottom). IOS does not use absolute coordinates, but relative coordinates 
		        representing a percentage of the element width or height.

                The results from the lookup are appended to the "Coords=" string

<p>
                Both Fields #3 and #5 are used to locate the item in the App Map.

                The Rational Robot implementation also supports using literal text in

                this field is NOT found to exist in the App Map as a Sub Key then it 
                will be used as literal text as if it HAD been retrieved from the App Map.
