                By default, mouse click on the center of the component.
                We can also mouse click on any part of an object, or any point relative to an object 
                based on a provided x,y coordinate or other component-specific parameters.  
                </p><p>
                The object to be mouse clicked is first given context and then a mouse click is 
                generated at the coordinates.  Thus, a subitem or object can be 
                referenced by name even though it is only recognized via coordinates.
                </p><p>
                The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND 
                Field #5 or by providing the literal text of the coordinates, where supported.</p>
<p>
                Typical Data Table records:</p>
<p>
                (1) t MainWindow MainWindow  MouseClick<br>
                (2) t MainWindow MainWindow  MouseClick AnObject<br>
                (3) t MainWindow FolderTree  MouseClick Node1<br>
                (4) t MainWindow MainWindow  MouseClick "50,200"<br>
                (5) t MainWindow MainWindow  MouseClick "Coords=50,200"</p>
<p>
                #2 above will contain an AnObject="3,10" entry in the MainWindow section 
                of the Application Map to mouse click at x=3, y=10 in the MainWindow.
                </p><p>
                #3 above will contain a FolderTree entry in the MainWindow section with 
                normal recognition information for it.  FolderTree will also have it's
                own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like 
                Node1="15,30".  This will tell Robot to locate the FolderTree Generic 
                object and mouse click at the coordinates specified by the reference.
                </p><p>
                #4 and #5 above show using literal text instead of an App Map entry to specify 
                where to mouse click relative to the item.
                </p><p>
                Rational Robot no longer requires the AppMapSubKey be provided and will 
                attempt to use the string as literal text if no AppMapSubKey is found in 
                the current App Map.  Robot also no longer assumes the AppMapSubKey value 
                or the literal value is presenting coordinate information.  This allows 
                components that can accept parameters other than coordinates, like table 
                row/col values or ImageMap areas to be specified.
                </p><p>
                If the value is deduced to contain coordinates, but is not prefixed with 
                "Coords=" text, then Robot will add the prefix.  Otherwise, the text value 
                will remain unmodified.
                </p><p>
		This is the direction we expect all tools to follow going forward.
		</p><p>
		Engines should also attempt to support coordinates separated by alternate separators.  
		The most common separators that should be supported would be:
		<ul>
<li>"," (comma) Example: "50,200"</li>
<li>";" (semi-colon) Example: "50;200"</li>
<li>" " (space) Example: "50 200"</li>
</ul>

                We expect the AppMap or literal text to contain the item in the format "x,y":</p>
<pre>
                [FolderTree]
                Node1="33,120"      OR
                Node1="Coords=33,120"
                ...
                [AnHTMLImage]
                AMappdedRegion=Coords=10,10
                ANamedRegion=AreaName=TechSupport
                AnIndexedRegion=AreaIndex=2
                AnotherRegion=AreaID=Contact
                </pre><p>  
                The results from the lookup are appended to the "Coords=" string 
                used by the MouseClick command in Robot (only if necessary).  So any 
                valid content used with the MouseClick command can be part of 
                this AppMap entry.</p>
<p>
                Both Fields #3 and #5 are used to locate the item in the App Map.
                This routine does not specify an App Map so only the current Map
                is used and it is expected to be valid.
                </p><p>
                The Rational Robot implementation also supports using literal text in 
                this parameter instead of an AppMapSubKey.  If the value retrieved from 
                this field is NOT found to exist in the App Map as a Sub Key then it 
                will be used as literal text as if it HAD been retrieved from the App Map.
